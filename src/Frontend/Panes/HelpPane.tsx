        <p>
          Dark Forest is a vast universe, obfuscated by zero-knowledge cryptography. Your{' '}
          <White>Explorer</White> explores the universe, searching for <White>Planets</White> and
          other players.
        </p>
        <p>
          All planets produce <White>Energy</White>. You can move energy from planets you own to new
          planets to conquer them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also scattered through the universe are <White>Asteroid Fields</White>, which produce{' '}
          <White>Silver</White>. Silver can be sent to planets and can be spent on{' '}
          <White>Upgrades</White>. Withdrawing silver from spacetime rips increases your{' '}
          <ScoreLabel />.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some planets contain <White>Artifacts</White> - ERC721 tokens that can be traded with
          other players. Artifacts can be harvested and deposited onto planets, buffing their stats.
          Harvesting artifacts also increases your <ScoreLabel />

          A snapshot of scores will be taken on <White>July 3, 2021</White> at 9PM Pacific Time. At
          that time, the top 63 highest-scoring players will be awarded prizes from a pool 63 prize
          planets. You can see the current rankings by scrolling down on the landing page of the
          game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your score is determined by the total amount of <White>Silver</White> you have withdrawn
          from the universe, plus additional bonuses for finding artifacts. Artifacts of different
          rarities are worth different amounts of points: Common are 5k, Rare are 20k, Epic are
          200k, <LegendaryLabel /> are 3M, and <MythicLabel /> are 20M.
